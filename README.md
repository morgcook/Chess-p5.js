# Chess-p5.js
A working chess board, using a mouse to select and move pieces. Made using the open-source Javascript library p5.js in 2023 when I was a Junior in high school.

Note that while I implemented the ability only to perform legal moves, the "en passant" and "castling" rules are not implemented and cannot be performed in this version.
