# Chess-p5.js
A working chess board, using a mouse to select and move pieces. Made using the open-source JavaScript library p5.js in 2023 when I was a Junior in high school. The majority of my individual code is within sketch.js and the two class files pieces.js and square.js.

Retrospectively, if I were to revisit this project or recreate it, I would use polymorphism to create a more general Piece class to reduce the unnecessary repetition in the pieces.js file. I would also implement the en passant and castling rules, as in this version they are not possible.
